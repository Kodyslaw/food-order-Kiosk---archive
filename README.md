# food-order-Kiosk---archive
!!!!!!!!!---JUST AN ARCHIVE---!!!!!!!!!!
Fun little project that i made years ago. Working on adapting it to modern standards. Won't change it in here tho. Posted it just for archive sake. Optimizations are going to get posted in seperate repository

Project was initally used to pass my tech school. My vice-principal was very amused with inclusion of anti-coke message when you're trying to buy it - he loves his Pepsi - to the point of school's network being named "Pepsi".

Program includes most functions expected to be avalible in typical vending machine (i've changed name to food ordering Kiosk because 15 chicken wings from kfc wasnt really possible to be sold at vending machine lol).

You can add products, change their prices, change exchange rates for currencies. You can't change the products itself without changing source code - work was handed last minute and i had no time to do it. Everything works on arrays so it shouldn't be hard to add it in newer release on seperate repository.
